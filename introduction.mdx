Welcome to the Modem API documentation. This guide is designed to help you navigate and effectively integrate our API into your application, so you can transform payment experiences for your customers across Africa. We’re committed to providing developers with a robust and flexible platform that simplifies payment processing and offers the essential tools for a secure and efficient transaction experience, especially for businesses operating in The Gambia and the broader continent.

Here’s what you can expect in this documentation:

- **API References**: Each endpoint is documented with descriptions, request/response formats, and examples. We use REST with JSON responses, so handling data is simple.

- **Error Handling**: Each endpoint lists possible status codes and error messages to help you manage issues quickly.

- **Single-Transaction Focus**: Our API is designed for individual requests, not bulk processing, to keep things reliable and secure.

- **Flexible Payment Options**: Our API fits the needs of African businesses with tools to shape the payment experience as you need.

With Modem, you have a straightforward, efficient payment platform ready to use across Africa.
