Transactions provide essential information on individual payment activities, such as successful payments, refunds, failed attempts, and cancelled transactions. Each transaction includes detailed data on the payment's origin, method, customer, and status, making it a powerful tool for tracking and managing financial activity within Modem Pay.

### Retrieve a Transaction

Use `retrieve` to get the complete details of a specific transaction by its ID. This is useful for checking the outcome, reviewing customer details, or troubleshooting any issues tied to a specific transaction.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const transaction = await modempay.transactions.retrieve(
    "5a24d5d0-1117-4f18-9a44-78112eac8aa1"
);
```
```python python
modem_pay.transactions.retrieve("5a24d5d0-1117-4f18-9a44-78112eac8aa1")
```
```bash curl
curl -X GET "https://api.modempay.com/v1/transactions/5a24d5d0..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

### List All Transactions

The `list` function returns all transactions, helping you monitor overall payment activity. This method is ideal for generating reports, reconciling payments, and tracking transaction volume over a given period.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const transactions = await modempay.transactions.list();
```
```python python
transactions = modem_pay.transactions.list()
```
```bash curl
curl -X GET "https://api.modempay.com/v1/transactions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

Additional pagination options let you control the number of transactions returned and navigate larger datasets.

### List All Transactions with Filtering Options

This flexibility is especially useful for generating tailored reports, narrowing down search results, or reviewing specific timeframes.

#### List Options

The `TransactionListOption` allows the following filtering and pagination options:

- `limit` (optional): Specifies the maximum number of transactions to return in a single call, enabling pagination of results.
- `search` (optional): A search term that filters results based on:
  - **Currency**: Matches transactions processed in the specified currency.
  - **Reference**: Filters by transaction reference for easy tracking.
  - **Payment Method**: Filters by the payment method used, such as credit card or bank transfer.
  - **Customer**: Filters based on customer details.
- `timeframe` (optional): Defines a duration in minutes to limit transactions to those created within the specified timeframe. This is helpful for retrieving recent activity or analyzing transactions over short intervals.

#### Example Usage

<CodeGroup>
```javascript node
const transactions = await modempay.transactions.list({
  limit: 20,
  search: "GMD",
  timeframe: 1440 // last 24 hours
});
```
```python python
transactions = modem_pay.transactions.list(
    options={"limit": 20, "search": "GMD", "timeframe": 1440}
)
```
```bash curl
curl -X GET "https://api.modempay.com/v1/transactions?limit=20&search=GMD&timeframe=1440" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

This example would retrieve up to 20 transactions processed in GMD over the past 24 hours.
