---

**Payment Links** in Modem Pay are designed to help businesses collect payments effortlessly through a hosted checkout page. With a unique link, customers can be directed to pay for items or services without requiring code-intensive solutions or complicated integrations. 

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Single-Charge Payments**: One-time payments, perfect for items or services.
- **Recurring Payments (Subscriptions)**: Set up links for ongoing payments.
- **Donations**: Enable variable amounts for donation collections.

A Payment Link is highly customizable, allowing the merchant to specify payment details like amount, currency, title, description, and additional form fields. These fields enable you to gather custom data from customers, such as details about the product or service, or special instructions.

### How it Works in Real Life

<Tip>
Fatou runs a boutique on Kairaba Avenue, selling elegant African prints and handcrafted accessories. Her shop, *Elegant Threads*, is popular among locals and tourists alike. But one challenge keeps coming up: customers often request to pay remotely for reserved items, especially during the busy festive seasons.  

One afternoon, a loyal customer, Mariama, calls from Banjul. She has her eye on a stunning wax print dress but won’t be able to visit the shop until next week. “Can I pay now to secure it?” Mariama asks.  

Fatou logs into the Modem Pay dashboard and quickly generates a payment link. She customizes it with the item’s name and price, D3,500 for the dress. Within seconds, she shares the link via WhatsApp.  

Mariama clicks the link, completes the payment, and sends a confirmation screenshot. The dress is now secured, waiting for her pickup.  

With Modem Pay’s payment link feature, Fatou keeps her customers happy and never misses a sale, even from miles away. On Kairaba Avenue, where businesses thrive on trust and connections, this simple tool has become a game-changer.
