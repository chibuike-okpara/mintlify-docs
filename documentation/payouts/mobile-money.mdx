### Initiate Payout
<Note>
When initiating a transfer, you must provide an <b>Idempotency-Key</b> in the request header. This ensures that if the same request is sent multiple times (for example, due to network issues), only one transfer will be processed. The <b>Idempotency-Key</b> should be a unique value (such as a UUID) for each transfer request.
</Note>

### Retrieve a Payout

You can fetch the details of a specific transfer using its unique `id`.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const transfer = await modemPay.transfers.retrieve("45eb796c...");
console.log(transfer.status); // e.g., 'completed'
```
```python python
transfer = modem_pay.transfers.retrieve("45eb796c...")
print(transfer["status"]); # e.g., 'completed'
```
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.modempay.com/v1/transfers/45eb796c... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."
```
</CodeGroup>

This returns the full transfer object with all metadata, status, and transaction history.

### Fraud Monitoring & Security

Modem Pay automatically monitors all payout transfers for suspicious or anomalous activity. If a transfer triggers our fraud detection systems, it is immediately flagged for review. When this happens:

- You will receive an email notification alerting you to the flagged transfer.
- A `transfer.flagged` webhook event will be sent to your configured webhook endpoint.

**Important:** No further transfers can be made to the affected account number until you review and resolve the flagged issue. This helps protect your business and recipients from potential fraud or misuse. Always investigate flagged transfers promptly to restore normal payout operations.
