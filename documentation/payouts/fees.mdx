title: Payout Fees
---

With Modem Pay, you can check how much a transfer will cost before proceeding. This allows you to estimate the total amount, including any fees that will be applied based on the payment network and transfer amount.

### Check Payout Fees

To check the fee for a transfer, use the `/v1/transfers/fees` endpoint. You can specify the transfer amount, currency, and network to get an estimate of the transfer fee.

  amount: 1000,
  currency: "GMD",

console.log(`Total amount: ${feeResponse.amount} ${feeResponse.currency}`);
```
```python python
from modempay import ModemPay

modem_pay = ModemPay(api_key="sk_test_...")

fee_response = modem_pay.transfers.fee(
    {"amount": 1000, "currency": "GMD", "network": "afrimoney"}
)

print(f"Payout fee: {fee_response['fee']} {fee_response['currency']}")
print(f"Total amount: {fee_response['amount']} {fee_response['currency']}")
```
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.modempay.com/v1/transfers/fees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

### Example Response

The following is a sample response returned from the API after querying the transfer fee:

```json
{
  "fee": 5,
  "currency": "GMD",
  "network": "afrimoney",
  "amount": 1000

```

In this example, the transfer fee is **5 GMD**, and the total amount to be debited (including fees) is **1,005 GMD**.
