title: Sessions
---

**Sessions** in Modem Pay are designed for flexible payment experiences that can adapt to a variety of scenarios. Unlike static [**Payment Links**](/core/payment-links), Sessions are dynamic and provide the flexibility to attach a customer directly, automatically populating saved payment methods if available. Sessions also come with an expiration setting, making them ideal for time-sensitive transactions like limited-time offers, reservations, or real-time booking payments.

### When to Use Sessions

Sessions are perfect for scenarios where:
- **Customer Details and Payment Methods**: You want a payment link to recognize and preload customer information, such as saved payment methods, making the checkout process smoother.
- **Expiration Setting**: Sessions can be set to expire after a specific duration. This feature makes them great for time-sensitive or one-off payment scenarios.
- **Dynamic Payments**: Sessions can adapt in real-time, capturing a customerâ€™s intent to pay and immediately reflecting any saved data.

### Example Scenarios

Below are some scenarios showcasing the versatility of Sessions.

---

#### 1. Session with Basic Parameters

A simple checkout session for a one-time payment for a service. This session doesn't have an associated customer and expires after 15 minutes.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const session = await modem.sessions.create({
    title: "Exclusive Webinar Access",
    description: "One-time payment for access to the live webinar event.",
    amount: 5000,
    currency: "GMD",
    redirect_url: "https://your-platform.com/success",
    cancel_url: "https://your-platform.com/cancel",
    expires_in: 15,
    custom_fields: ["Attendee Name", "Company"],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

---

#### 2. Session with Attached Customer and Saved Payment Methods

For recurring users, attaching a customer to the session lets Modem Pay retrieve saved payment methods. The session expiration is set to 10 minutes.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const sessionWithCustomer = await modem.sessions.create({
    title: "Payment for Premium Content",
    description: "Payment for premium content access.",
    amount: 1500,
    currency: "GMD",
    customer: "d9bf8831-4db5-4a1c-8aa0-3de72492f330",
    redirect_url: "https://your-platform.com/success",
    cancel_url: "https://your-platform.com/cancel",
    expires_in: 10,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, if the customer has a saved payment method, it will be automatically populated, streamlining the checkout process and providing a seamless payment experience.

---

#### 3. Session with Additional Customer Details (Non-registered Customer)

If a new customer hasn't registered or saved a payment method, the session can still be configured to include relevant customer details.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const guestSession = await modem.sessions.create({
    title: "Special Course Payment",
    description: "One-time payment for a specialized course module.",
    amount: 8000,
    currency: "GMD",
    customer_email: "guest@example.com",
    customer_name: "John Doe",
    customer_phone: "3000011",
    redirect_url: "https://your-platform.com/success",
    cancel_url: "https://your-platform.com/cancel",
    expires_in: 20,
});
```
</CodeGroup>
