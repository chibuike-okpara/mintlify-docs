A **Payment Intent** in Modem Pay represents a user's intention to pay a specified amount. It is used to initiate a payment process and generate a link for the customer to complete the transaction securely.

### Payment Intent Object

The **Payment Intent** object contains the following properties:

- **amount**: The total amount to be paid.
- **currency**: The currency of the payment (optional).
- **payment_methods**: A list of accepted payment methods (optional) (e.g., "card", "bank", "wallet").
- **title**: A title for the payment (optional).
- **description**: A description of the payment (optional).
- **customer**: The ID of the customer making the payment (optional).
- **customer_name**: The name of the customer making the payment (optional).
- **customer_email**: The email address of the customer making the payment (optional).
- **customer_phone**: The phone number of the customer making the payment (optional).
- **metadata**: Any additional information about the payment (optional).
- **return_url**: The URL to which the customer is redirected after a successful payment (optional).
- **cancel_url**: The URL to which the customer is redirected if they cancel the payment (optional).
- **payment_method**: The specific payment method to use (optional).
- **coupon**: The ID of a coupon to apply to the payment (optional). If provided, the coupon's discount will be applied to the payment amount.
- **callback_url**: The endpoint where Modem Pay will send a webhook notification after the payment has been processed.
- **skip_url_validation**: Set to `true` to bypass Modem Pay's validation of the `cancel_url` or `return_url`. This is most commonly needed when these URLs use mobile app deeplinks, allowing you to return users directly into your app.

#### Payment Intent Response Object

These are the response properties after the Payment Intent is created:

- **status**: A boolean value indicating whether the payment intent creation was successful. Returns `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.
- **message**: A descriptive message about the result of the Payment Intent creation (e.g., "Payment intent created successfully. Please proceed to complete the payment.").
- **data**: An object containing the details of the payment intent. The properties inside this object are:
  - **intent_secret**: A secret key used to secure the payment intent, required for completing the payment.
  - **payment_link**: A URL to the hosted payment page where the customer can complete the payment.
  - **amount**: The total amount to be paid, expressed in the currency specified in **currency**.
  - **currency**: The currency code (e.g., `GMD` for Gambian Dalasi) in which the payment is to be made.
  - **expires_at**: A timestamp (ISO 8601 format) indicating when the payment intent will expire. After this time, the payment intent will no longer be valid.
  - **status**: The current status of the payment intent. It can be one of the following:
    - `requires_payment_method`: Payment method is required before proceeding.
    - `processing`: The payment is currently being processed.
    - `successful`: The payment was successfully completed.
    - `failed`: The payment failed to process.
    - `cancelled`: The payment was canceled by the customer or the system.
