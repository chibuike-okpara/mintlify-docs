title: Direct Charge
---

You can set up a **direct charge** by providing the `network` and the 7-digit `account_number` (no country code). This prefills the customerâ€™s details in checkout, pending their confirmation.

Accepted networks:

* `wave`
* `afrimoney`
* `qmoney`

Works only with **mobile money**.
