title: Create a Payment Intent
---

The **Payment Intent** represents an intention to complete a payment. You can create a Payment Intent by specifying key details like the payment amount, the customer, and the payment method.

#### General Workflow
To create a payment intent, you generally follow these steps:
1. Specify the amount the customer needs to pay.
2. Optionally, provide additional information such as the customer details, payment methods, and redirect URLs.
3. Receive a link to the payment page, where the customer can complete the payment.

### Scenarios for Creating a Payment Intent

#### 1. **Creating a Payment Intent with Just Amount**

In this simplest scenario, you only need to provide the amount that needs to be paid. This is the most basic setup for a payment.

- **Scenario**: You want to create a payment intent for a customer to pay GMD 450, but you do not specify a customer or any other optional parameters.
- **Request**:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs 
const paymentIntent = await modem.paymentIntents.create({ amount: 450 });
```
</CodeGroup>

- **Result**: A Payment Intent is created with a link to the payment page, where the customer can complete the payment.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Payment intent created successfully. Please proceed to complete the payment.",
  "data": {
    "intent_secret": "b6d892d9fc58a93b04182f44d46e2549aa0b209c15949275a7dca9a55a59b125",
    "payment_link": "http://localhost:3001/284997c2-9651-4855-8e0a-fd2403458f89",
    "amount": 450,
    "currency": "GMD",
    "expires_at": "2025-01-14T11:11:10.356Z",
    "status": "requires_payment_method"
  }
}
```


#### 2. **Creating a Payment Intent with Amount and Customer**

In this scenario, in addition to specifying the amount, you also specify the customer who will be making the payment. This helps associate the payment with a particular customer for better tracking.

- **Scenario**: You want to create a payment intent for GMD 450 and associate it with a specific customer.
- **Request**:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs 
const paymentIntent = await modem.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 450,
    customer: "d9bf8831-4db5-4a1c-8aa0-3de72492f330",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

#### 3. **Creating a Payment Intent with Amount, Customer, and Payment Methods**

This scenario involves a more specific setup where you specify the amount, associate the intent with a customer, and predefine the payment methods the customer will use. This is useful when you want to guarantee specific methods of payment.

- **Scenario**: You want to create a payment intent for GMD 450, associate it with a customer, and specify that the payment should be processed using a particular payment method.
- **Request**:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs 
const paymentIntent = await modem.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 450,
    customer: "d9bf8831-4db5-4a1c-8aa0-3de72492f330",
    payment_methods: ["card"],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

#### 4. **Creating a Payment Intent with Amount, Customer, and Specific Payment Method ID**

In this scenario, you create a Payment Intent specifying a particular customer's payment method ID. This is useful when you want to charge a customer using a specific saved payment method, such as a stored card or bank account.

- **Scenario**: You want to create a payment intent for GMD 450, associate it with a specific customer, and use a specific saved payment method ID from the customerâ€™s account. This setup allows you to charge a saved payment method directly, streamlining the payment process for returning customers.

- **Request**:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs 
const paymentIntent = await modem.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 450,
    payment_method: "ad47ccb9-687c-475b-90dc-1dd3b4cba68e",
    customer: "d9bf8831-4db5-4a1c-8aa0-3de72492f330",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Common Optional Parameters for Creating a Payment Intent

While the **amount** is the only required parameter for creating a payment intent, you can optionally include other parameters to enhance the payment flow:

- **currency**: The currency for the payment (optional). If omitted, the default currency will be used.
- **title**: A title for the payment (optional).
- **description**: A description of the payment (optional).
- **metadata**: Any additional custom data (optional).
- **return_url**: A URL to which the customer will be redirected after completing the payment (optional).
- **cancel_url**: A URL to which the customer will be redirected if they cancel the payment (optional).

### Conclusion

Creating a Payment Intent is a straightforward process. By specifying just the **amount**, or additionally associating the intent with a **customer** and **payment method**, you can tailor the payment flow to meet specific needs. Once created, you will receive a unique link that the customer can use to complete the payment. This flexible setup ensures a seamless payment experience.
