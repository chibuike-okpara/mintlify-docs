title: Payment Intent Callbacks
---

Modem Pay supports specifying a **callback URL** per payment intent. This allows you to receive event notifications for that specific payment directly at the URL you provide, overriding your global webhook URL.

The same types of events (such as `payment_intent.created`, `charge.succeeded`, `charge.failed`, etc.) are sent to your `callback_url`. The process for handling these events is almost identical, except for the authentication method (see below). For more details on event types and recommended handling, refer to the [Webhooks documentation](/documentation/core/webhooks).


## 1. Creating a Payment Intent with a Callback URL

When creating a payment intent, you can include an optional `callback_url` parameter to specify where you want Modem Pay to send event notifications related to this payment.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs 
const paymentIntent = await modempay.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 450,
  callback_url: "https://yourapp.com/payment-callback",
});
```
```python python 
payment_intent = modem_pay.payment_intents.create(
    params={
        "amount": 450,
        "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/payment-callback",
    }
)
```
```bash cURL 
cURL -X POST "https://api.modempay.com/v1/payments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "amount": 450,
      "callback_url": "https://yourapp.com/payment-callback",
      "from_sdk": false
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. How the Callback URL Works

* If `callback_url` is provided in the payment intent, Modem Pay sends event notifications (e.g., `charge.succeeded`, `charge.failed`) to this URL **instead of** your global webhook URL.
* If no `callback_url` is set, events are sent to your global webhook as usual.
* This allows for more granular control and flexibility, especially useful for marketplaces or third-party integrations where different payments require different handling.

## 3. Security and Validation

* All requests sent to the `callback_url` include an `x-modem-signature` header containing a signature that is signed with your **merchant secret key** for authentication.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript js-sdk
const event = modempay.webhooks.composeEventDetails(
    payload,
    xSignatureHeader,
    yourSecretKey
);
```
```python python-sdk
event = modem_pay.webhooks.compose_event_details(
    payload, xSignatureHeader, yourSecretKey
)
```

</CodeGroup>
<Info>
For complete webhook validation examples in other programming languages (Python, Go, etc.), please refer to our [Webhooks documentation](/documentation/core/webhooks). When validating callback URL events, use your **merchant secret key** instead of the webhook signing key.
</Info>

* This differs from the global webhook which uses a separate **signing key** and payload signatures for verification.

* To secure your endpoint:

  * Verify that incoming requests include a valid signature in the `x-modem-signature` header.
  * Ensure your callback URL uses **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit.
  * Implement proper timeout and retry logic, as Modem Pay will retry failed callback attempts up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
