title: Sub-Accounts
---

Sub-accounts are the backbone of **Split Payments**. They define who receives a portion of a transaction and where that money should go. Each sub-account can have a **percentage of the transaction** and a **settlement destination**.

With sub-accounts, you can:

* Automate revenue sharing
* Maintain a transparent audit trail for settlements
* Track balances for each partner before actual payout

<Note>
The **minimum split amount** per transaction is **1 GMD**.  
Before a sub-account can receive a payout, it must have accumulated at least **10 GMD** in its balance. This ensures efficient settlement and reduces transaction costs.
</Note>

## Create a Sub-Account

Creates a new recipient account that can be used in split payments.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const subAccount = await modempay.subAccounts.create({
  business_name: "Hail-Ma",
  percentage: 10,             // Revenue share (integer %)
  settlement_code: "afrimoney", // Settlement provider (wave or afrimoney)
  account_number: 7012345,      // Account to receive funds
});
```
```python python
sub_account = mp.sub_accounts.create(
    params={
        "business_name": "Hail-Ma",
        "percentage": 10,
        "settlement_code": "afrimoney",
        "account_number": 7012345,
    }
)
```
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.modempay.com/v1/sub-accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "business_name": "Hail-Ma",
      "percentage": 10,
      "settlement_code": "afrimoney",
      "account_number": 7012345,
    }'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Notes & Best Practices:**

* Ensure the `percentage` is appropriate; total splits should not exceed 100%.
* The `settlement_code` must match an active payment provider integrated with Modem Pay.
* Keep the `account_number` accurate to avoid failed settlements.
* You can create multiple sub-accounts and reuse them across payment intents.

## Retrieve a Sub-Account

Fetch details for a specific sub-account using its unique ID. Useful for confirming configuration or checking balances.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const subAccount = await modempay.subAccounts.retrieve("5bfcc08....810b");
console.log(subAccount);
```

```python python
sub_account = mp.sub_accounts.retrieve("5bfcc08....810b")
print(sub_account)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.modempay.com/v1/sub-accounts/5bfcc08....810b \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

## List All Sub-Accounts

Get a list of all sub-accounts associated with your business. This is helpful for dashboards or automated scripts.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const allSubAccounts = await modempay.subAccounts.list();
console.log(allSubAccounts);
```
```python python
all_sub_accounts = mp.sub_accounts.list()
print(all_sub_accounts)
```
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.modempay.com/v1/sub-accounts?term=""&limit=15&offset=0 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Notes:**

* Can be filtered by search term.
* Supports pagination using `offset` and `limit` parameters
* Returns pagination info if there are many sub-accounts.


## Update a Sub-Account

Modify a sub-accountâ€™s properties like percentage share or settlement destination.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const updatedSubAccount = await modempay.subAccounts.update("5bfcc08....810b", {
  percentage: 15,         // Update revenue share
  account_number: 7016789, // Update account number
});
console.log(updatedSubAccount);
```
```python python
updated_sub_account = mp.sub_accounts.update(
    "5bfcc08....810b",
    {
        "percentage": 15,         # Update revenue share
        "account_number": 7016789 # Update account number
    }
)
print(updated_sub_account)
```
```bash cURL
curl -X PUT https://api.modempay.com/v1/sub-accounts/5bfcc08....810b \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "percentage": 15,
    "account_number": 7016789
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

**Notes:**
* You can update the fields: `active`, `percentage`, `account_number`, and `settlement_code`.
* Updates take effect on future transactions, not on already processed ones.
* Avoid reducing percentages that would make total splits exceed 100%.

## Additional Tips

* **Balances:** Each sub-account maintains an internal balance until settlement occurs.
* **Audit:** Always store sub-account IDs and percentages used per payment intent to keep your records consistent.
* **Multiple Sub-Accounts:** Currently, a payment intent supports one sub-account. Future updates will allow multiple sub-accounts per transaction.
