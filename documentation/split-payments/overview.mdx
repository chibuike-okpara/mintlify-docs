With **Split Payments**, you can share the settlement of a transaction with one or more sub-accounts. This allows you to automatically distribute revenue between multiple parties without manual transfers or spreadsheets.

Whether you’re running a marketplace, school, agency, or any business that needs to share revenue, Split Payments makes it easy to:

* **Create sub-accounts:** Assign each recipient their own account within Modem Pay.
* **Set revenue percentages:** Decide what portion of a transaction each sub-account receives.
* **Automate settlements:** Modem Pay calculates and distributes payouts according to the defined splits.

**Example:**
A customer pays **1,000 GMD**. You have a sub-account set up to receive **10%**, and your main business account receives **90%**. After the transaction is processed:

* Main account balance: 900 GMD
* Sub-account balance: 100 GMD

This removes the headache of manual revenue sharing, ensures transparency, and keeps your business and partners’ payouts accurate and timely.
