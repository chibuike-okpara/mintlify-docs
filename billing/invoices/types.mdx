title: Invoice Types
---

Modem Pay automatically determines your invoice type based on the data you provide.

## Simple Invoices

Simple invoices contain a single total amount without itemized breakdown. They're automatically created when you **don't include line items**.

### When to Use Simple Invoices

- **Fixed Subscription Plans** - Monthly/annual fees
- **Membership Dues** - Gym memberships, club fees
- **Service Subscriptions** - SaaS with flat-rate pricing
- **Donations** - Single amount payments
- **Simple Service Fees** - Consulting retainers

### Example: Monthly SaaS Subscription

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const invoice = await modempay.invoices.create({
  amount: 2500,
  customer_email: "user@modempay.com",
  customer_name: "Modem Pay Inc", 
  due_date: "2025-12-31",
  notes: "Pro Plan - December 2025"
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### With Discounts

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const invoice = await modempay.invoices.create({
  amount: 5000,
  customer: "b7ca54db-a2ad-4153-8603-d8873dbffc2d",
  discount: {
    type: "percentage",
    amount: 20 // 20% discount
  }
});

// Calculation:
// Subtotal: 5000
// Discount: 1000 (20% of 5000) 
// Total: 4000
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
For simple invoices, the `amount` becomes the subtotal, and discounts calculate the final total.
</Info>

## Professional Invoices

Professional invoices include detailed line items. They're automatically created when you **include the `line_items` array**.

### When to Use Professional Invoices

- **Usage-Based Billing** - Metered services, API calls
- **Multi-Product Subscriptions** - Bundles with multiple components  
- **Tiered Pricing** - Base fee + overage charges
- **Product Sales** - E-commerce with multiple items
- **Transparent Pricing** - When customers need breakdowns


### Example: Usage-Based Subscription

<CodeGroup>
```typescript nodejs
const invoice = await modempay.invoices.create({
  amount: 0,
  customer_email: "api-customer@tech.com",
  customer_name: "Tech Guru",
  line_items: [
    {
      item: "API Calls",
      quantity: 150000,
      unit_price: 0.02
    },
    {
      item: "Storage (GB)",
      quantity: 50,
      unit_price: 100
    },
    {
      item: "Pro Plan Base Fee",
      quantity: 1, 
      unit_price: 2000
    }
  ]
});

// Auto-calculated:
// API Calls: 150,000 × 0.02 = 3000
// Storage: 50 × 100 = 5000  
// Base Fee: 1 × 2000 = 2000
// Total: 10,000
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
The `amount` parameter is ignored when line items are present. Total is calculated from line items.
</Tip>

## Discount Types

### Percentage Discount

```typescript
{
  discount: {
    type: "percentage",
    amount: 15 // 15% off
  }
}
```

### Fixed Amount Discount

```typescript
{
  discount: {
    type: "fixed", 
    amount: 500 // 500 off
  }
}
```
