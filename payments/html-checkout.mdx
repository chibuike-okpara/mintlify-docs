title: HTML Checkout
---

Imagine a small bakery, *Sweet Crumbs*, nestled in a bustling Serrekunda. It’s run by Aminata, who has mastered the art of baking but struggles with technology. One day, a customer asks, "Do you have an online payment option?"  

Determined not to lose sales, Amina turns to HTML Checkout. With just a few lines of code, her website gains the ability to accept payments.  

Here’s how it looks:  


```html html
<form action="https://checkout.modempay.com/api/pay" method="POST">
  <h3>Chocolate Cake</h3>
  <p>Delicious and freshly baked. Pay now to enjoy!</p>
  <input type="hidden" name="public_key" value="pk_test_971deb266f73e90c1083983e684a765dabe163c59b94c0d22dfdb8172f1915a0">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="150">
  <input type="hidden" name="currency" value="GMD">
  <button type="submit">Pay GMD 150</button>
</form>
```

With this simple form, her customers can now order their favorite cakes online and pay instantly. No fancy frameworks, no complicated integrations, just pure HTML doing what it does best.  

By the weekend, *Sweet Crumbs* receives its first online payment. Amina watches her business grow, one click at a time, as her delicious creations reach new corners of the city.  

It’s not just a solution; it’s a story of transformation, proving that sometimes, simplicity is the sweetest recipe of all.
