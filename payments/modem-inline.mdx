title: Inline Modem Payment
---

Modem Pay's inline integration allows you to seamlessly add a payment option directly to your website, enabling your customers to make payments without leaving the page. This integration provides a smooth and efficient checkout process, ideal for businesses looking to enhance user experience and maximize conversion rates.

By using this integration, you can implement a "Pay Now" button that triggers a payment flow directly on your site, avoiding pop-ups or redirects. This is especially useful for scenarios like product purchases, service subscriptions, or event ticket sales.

<Warning> 
**Public Key**

Keep in mind that this is client-side code, so it utilizes your public key rather than your secret key.
</Warning>

## How Callbacks and onClose Work


Here's an example that demonstrates how to use both the `callback` and `onClose` functions. The `callback` function sends a verification request to the backend in the background. Meanwhile, the `onClose` function handles the modal closure by displaying a "verifying" message if the background request is still in progress, or a thank-you message if the verification succeeds. If the verification fails, the user is prompted to retry or contact support.

### **`callback`: Handling Successful Payments**

The `callback` function allows you to perform actions after a successful payment. For instance, you can verify the transaction, send a confirmation email, or update your database. The `transaction` parameter contains essential information about the payment.

<Warning>
The `redirect_url` takes priority over the `callback`. If both are provided, the `redirect_url` will be used.
</Warning>



```javascript javascript
function makePayment() {
  const modal = ModemPayCheckout({
    public_key:
      "pk_test_e073bbf9db47b09cebfdf2f7ec147d02116b69ea55135e1747a0bc8d47612f69",
    // ...
    callback: function (transaction) {
      // Handle the transaction success and verify on backend
      verifyTransactionOnBackend(transaction.id, modal);
    },
  });
}
```
<Warning>
Always verify the payment on your server after the transaction, even if a callback was used.
</Warning>
<Note>
Keep in mind that the `callback` function is triggered after the payment is completed, even while the modal remains open. For an enhanced user experience, you can combine the `callback` with the `onClose` handler.
</Note>

### **`onClose`: Handling Payment Cancellations**

The `onClose` function is invoked when the customer cancels the payment by closing the modal. This is particularly useful for logging or notifying users of incomplete transactions.

```javascript javascript
function makePayment() {
  const modal = ModemPayCheckout({
    public_key:
      "pk_test_e073bbf9db47b09cebfdf2f7ec147d02116b69ea55135e1747a0bc8d47612f69",
    // ...
    onClose: function (cancelled) {
      if (cancelled) {
        // handle cancellation
      }
    },
  });
}
```

### Precedence Between `callback`, `return_url`, and `onClose`

- **`return_url` vs `callback`:**  
  If both are provided, the `return_url` will take precedence, and the user will be redirected to the specified URL after the payment instead of executing the `callback` function.
  
- **`cancel_url` vs `onClose`:**  
  If a `cancel_url` is provided, it overrides the `onClose` function, and the user will be redirected to the specified URL upon cancellation.

## Webhooks

If you have configured [webhook notifications](/documentation/core/webhooks) for your account, we will send a webhook when the payment is completed, as well as for any failed payment attempts. Here's an example of the webhook payload:

```json
