**Payment Links** in Modem are designed to help businesses collect payments effortlessly through a hosted checkout page. With a unique link, customers can be directed to pay for items or services without requiring code-intensive solutions or complicated integrations. 

**Primary Use Cases**:
- **Single-Charge Payments**: One-time payments, perfect for items or services.
