title: Manage Sessions
---

Efficient session management is essential to ensure smooth transactions and handle time-sensitive payment links in Modem. You can retrieve specific sessions, list all sessions for a more comprehensive view, and manually expire sessions as needed.

---

### Retrieve a Session

Use the retrieve method to access detailed information about a single session by its unique session ID. This is particularly useful for checking the status, customer information, amount, and other details of a specific session.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const session = await modem.sessions.retrieve("2f4145b6-5a8b-4ec7-b62a-246b4424d351");
```
</CodeGroup>

This command will return the full session object, allowing you to view properties such as:
- **Session Status**: Check if it's active or expired.
- **Customer Information**: View customer details if associated.
- **Payment Link**: Access the direct payment URL.
- **Custom Fields and Metadata**: Any additional fields or custom data stored with the session.

---

### List All Sessions

The list method provides a summary of all sessions, allowing you to monitor and manage multiple sessions at once. This feature is helpful for tracking recent payment activity, handling session statuses, and generating reports.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const sessions = await modem.sessions.list();
```
</CodeGroup>

Pagination options are also available to limit the number of sessions retrieved per request and to navigate through large datasets.

---

### Expire a Session

If a session needs to be invalidated manually, perhaps due to a canceled order or an expired offer, you can expire it immediately. Once expired, the session’s payment link becomes unusable.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript nodejs
const expiredSession = await modem.sessions.expire(
    "2f4145b6-5a8b-4ec7-b62a-246b4424d351"
);
```
</CodeGroup>

When a session is expired:
- **Status**: Changes to `expired`.
- **Link Invalidity**: The payment link becomes inactive, preventing any further actions by the customer.
- **Error Prevention**: Customers attempting to access an expired link will encounter a notification that the session is no longer available.

This action can’t be undone, ensuring that expired sessions remain securely inactive.
